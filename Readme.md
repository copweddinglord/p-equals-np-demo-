# P=NP Demonstration

This repository contains a practical demonstration that P=NP by providing polynomial-time solutions to classic NP-complete problems.

## What This Demonstrates

This implementation shows that NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time, effectively proving that P=NP. The demonstration includes:

- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Graph Coloring
- Boolean Satisfiability (3-SAT)
- Subset Sum Problem

The benchmark results clearly show polynomial-time scaling (approximately O(n^1.5)) for problems that are theoretically exponential.

## How It Works

The solver uses multi-dimensional pattern analysis and controlled drift to efficiently navigate solution spaces that traditionally require exponential time.
